### Reference Hierarchy

Use the following references, including this guide, in this order:

1. **Project-specific style** - give priority to style guidance specified by the project that may be different from the standard PaperMoon styling
2. **This style guide** - if the project hasn't specified a preference on a styling question, then follow this guide
3. [**Google developer documentation style guide**](https://developers.google.com/style){target=\_blank} - if the preceding reference don't provide guidance, follow the Google style guide
4. **Discuss with the team** - if you make it through the preceding references without an answer, bring the issue to the team for a styling decision

To make it easier to use this style guide as a companion to the Google style guide, the sections and headings are similarly structured. 

## Guidance, Not Rules

These guidelines are intended to make consistency across documentation easier, not to be rules set in stone. This style guide is a living document.  Expect it to evolve as we collectively grow in our craft.
