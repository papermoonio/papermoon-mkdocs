# Templates

## Introduction

Templates are a tool to help ensure consistency and quality across our work product. They have an added bonus of acting as boilerplate code to reduce repetitive work for creators as they develop new pieces of content. The templates in this section draw heavily upon the work of [The Good Docs Project](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/){target=\_blank} which is rooted in the principles of [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/){target=\_blank}.

In this section you will find templates for the four primary documenation types identified in Diataxis: tutorial, how-to guide, explanation, and reference. Please review the following section for help with selecting the best template for your content based upon the needs of the user.

## How-To Use the Templates

Deciding which template best fits the content you want to create can be tricky, especially when it comes to differentiating tutorials from how-to guides.
