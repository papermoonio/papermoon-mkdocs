# Templates

## Introduction

Templates are a tool to help ensure consistency and quality across our work product. They have an added bonus of acting as boilerplate code to reduce repetitive work for creators as they develop new pieces of content. The templates in this section draw heavily upon the work of [The Good Docs Project](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/){target=\_blank} which is rooted in the principles of [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/){target=\_blank}.

In this section you will find templates for the four primary documenation types identified in Diataxis: tutorial, how-to guide, concept, and reference. Please review the following section for help with selecting the best template for your content based upon the needs of the user.

## How-To Use the Templates

Deciding which template best fits the content you want to create can be tricky, especially when it comes to differentiating tutorials from how-to guides. The following sections provide guidance for selecting the best template category with links to available templates by project. 

### Concept

The concept template is used for informational pages intended to increase the user's understanding of a topic. Concept pages are typically grouped together into a section. Some example concept section names per project are as follows:

| Project  | Concept page section |
|:---------|:---------------------|
| Moonbeam | Learn                |
| Polkadot | Polkadot Protocol    |
| Tanssi   | Learn                |
| Wormhole | Learn                |

### How-To Guide

The how-to guide template is used for instructional pages meant to help the user solve a real-world problem or complete a task. 

It can be helpful to think about cooking when deciding between a how-to guide and tutorial. If someone already knows how to cook, they can use a recipe as long as it has a complete list of what they need (ingredients, equipment) and clear, orderly steps to follow. It is assumed the user understands the meaning of "sautee the onions" or "bake until golden brown." Some context like "the dough will be sticky" may be added for things that  differ from what the user expects. For the most part though, the required items and steps will get the job done.

Some example how-to guide section names per project are as follows:

| Project  | How-to guide section |
|:---------|:---------------------|
| Moonbeam | Builders             |
| Polkadot | Develop              |
| Tanssi   | Builders             |
| Wormhole | Build                |
