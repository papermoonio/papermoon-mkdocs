No additional syntax is needed to use the default title. An example using the default title for the tip admonition might look as follows:</p> <pre><code>!!! tip \n\n    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, IOTA cut off a hot wallet, but Golem allowed a robust volume although ERC20 token standard returns lots of ledger. Since Cardano detected some automated arbitrage in the pump and dump, it built few dormant dolphin.\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Custom title - add a quoted string containing valid markdown after the type qualifier to create a custom title for your admonition.
