This section covers how to change the title to customize an admonition. Select a title to view an example of the styling for that title option.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Default title - admonitions will default to using the type qualifier (<code>tip</code>, <code>note</code>, or <code>warning</code>) in titlecase. No additional syntax is needed to use the default title. An example using the default title for the tip admonition might look as follows:</p> <pre><code>!!! tip \n\n    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, IOTA cut off a hot wallet, but Golem allowed a robust volume although ERC20 token standard returns lots of ledger. Since Cardano detected some automated arbitrage in the pump and dump, it built few dormant dolphin.\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Custom title - add a quoted string containing valid markdown after the type qualifier to create a custom title for your admonition. The following example updates the <code>tip</code> admonition with a custom title:</p> <pre><code>!!! tip \"Basic attention token based on few\"\n\n    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, IOTA cut off a hot wallet, but Golem allowed a robust volume although ERC20 token standard returns lots of ledger. Since Cardano detected some automated arbitrage in the pump and dump, it built few dormant dolphin.\n</code></pre> <p>If you need a custom admonition title, considered whether adding a heading and copy to the body of your page would be a better way to communicate the message. Custom admonition titles should use sentence case.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"style-guide/formatting-organization/notes-and-notices/#use-layout-admonitions","title":"Use Layout Admonitions","text":"<p>Guidance for using layout admonitions is currently being developed.
